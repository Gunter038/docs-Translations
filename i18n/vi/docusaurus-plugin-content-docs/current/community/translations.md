## Guide

### Code

Some pages contain metadata and computer code.

It is important to keep in mind that William Shakespear was an English speaker...So was Alan Turing! That is why you should not translate parts of the code "itslef". For instance, if you see metadata like `sidebar_label : Hello World`, a French translation would be `sidebar_label : Salut tout le monde`.

Let's take another example, you wouldn't have to translate anything here :
```sh
cd $HOME
rm -rf celestia-app
git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app.git
cd celestia-app/
APP_VERSION=$(curl -s \
  https://api.github.com/repos/celestiaorg/celestia-app/releases/latest \
  | jq -r ".tag_name")
git checkout tags/$APP_VERSION -b $APP_VERSION
make install
```

You don't have to translate URLs in your language.

### Specific words

As you will translate innovative concepts, like Data Availability Sampling, feel free to discuss about the best possible translation with the rest of the community. Also be careful with date order, period and commas regarding numbers from a language to another.
