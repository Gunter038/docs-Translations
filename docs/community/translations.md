# Community Translation Support

If you are a passionate Celestia community member who would like to contribute
to translating the documentation page, then this is the guide for you.

## Fork the Celestia Documentation Repository

Go to the Docs Repository [here](https://github.com/celestiaorg/docs).

Fork the repository to have your own fork of it. Now, with your own fork,
you can start working on the translation steps.

## Specify the Language You Want to Translate To

Here, you need to select the language you want to translate to.

Once you decide that, you can follow the tutorial that Docusaurus has
outlined in order to begin your translation journey.

The tutorial is found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/tutorial).
